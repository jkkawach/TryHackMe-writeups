Investigating the web server reveals nothing immediate. We search for directories using FFUF.

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u http://10.10.18.117/FUZZ -c -t 100 -v
```

A brief explanation of the flags/switches used:
- `-w` specifies the path to the wordlist.
- `-u` specifics the URL, where `FUZZ` indicates the place we should fuzz.
- `-t` specifies the number of threads to use. The default is 40.
- `-v` gives verbose output.
- `-c` makes the output colourful.

Eventually, we find the `/retro` directory. Navigating to this page leads us to a retro gaming blog. We immediately find a username and a link to a login form.

We also find a blog post revealing some potentially useful information.

At bit of Googling tells us that the name of the avatar that Wade keeps mistyping is referring to is `parzival`.  This turns out to be the password, we we use to log in to Wade's WordPress account.

If we didn't have access to the information given away by Wade, we would have to use Hydra to brute force the login. We already have a possible username, so let's submit the login request to Burp to capture the body of the POST request. Our Hydra command looks like:

```bash
hydra -l Wade -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.18.117 http-post-form "/retro/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:The password you entered" -v
```

(At this point, it seems that my machine died. Terminating and trying a new one.)

Hydra doesn't seem to be working here, as the connection seems to time out. Let's try wpscan.

`wpscan --url http://10.10.127.19/retro/wp-login.php -U Wade -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
`

This also doesn't seem to work. Luckily, we already have the password!
