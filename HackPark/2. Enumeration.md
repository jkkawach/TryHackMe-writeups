Investigating the web server on port 80, we eventually find a login page.

A quick Google search tells us that the default credentials for blogengine are admin:admin; this does not work in this instance, but we make note of this for later. Right-clicking on the log in button and using Firefox's inspect tool, we can determine the request type used by the log in form.

Alternatively, we can send the request through BurpSuite:

This will be useful later, as we will need the body of the POST request.
