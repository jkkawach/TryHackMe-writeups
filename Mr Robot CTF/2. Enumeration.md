We begin by investigating the output given by the autorecon scan. Examining the `robots.txt` file reveals some information.

Navigating to `http://10.10.89.74/key-1-of-3.txt` gives us the first key. The `robots.txt` also points us a wordlist at `http://10.10.89.74/fsocity.dic`, which we download.

From the feroxbuster output generated by Autorecon, we see an interesting directory.

Getting the body of the POST request of the login form using BurpSuite, we can try Hydra to brute force the login.

```bash
hydra -l <username guess> -P <path to wordlist> 10.10.89.74 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:<error message for unsuccessful login>" -V
```

In this case, we want to use the wordlist `fsocity.dic` we found earlier. But first we need a username. Note that if we type in some test credentials, we get an error message which tells us the username is invalid.

</center>

We can make use of this to try and find a valid username from our dictionary.

```bash
hydra -L fsocity.dic -p test 10.10.89.74 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:Invalid username" -v 
```

</center>

Thus we obtain the username `Elliot` (which maybe you could have gussed, given the theme of the box). If we attempt to login using this username, this verifies that `Elliot` is indeed a valid username. This also gives us another error message we can use with Hydra.

</center>

Now we can attempt to run Hydra. We can either wait a very long time for Hydra to find the correct password, or we can cleanup the wordlist we found first. Using ``sort fsocity.dic | tee sorted.txt`` will list the words alphabetically. Then, ``uniq sorted.txt | tee trimmedlist.txt`` will remove any duplicate instances. Using `wc -l <file name>`, we can verify that this substantially reduced the size of our wordlist.

</center>

Now we run Hydra again with the trimmed wordlist to find our password. 

```bash
hydra -l Elliot -P trimmedlist.txt 10.10.89.74 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:The password you entered" -v -t 32
```

The `-t` switch specifies the number of tasks to run in parallel. The default is 16; I upped it since the attack was taking a long time. After almost 40 minutes, Hydra found the correct password.

Alternatively, [wpscan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) can be leveraged here since we know the blog is running on WordPress. We can use `wpscan --url http://10.10.89.74/wp-login.php -U Elliot -P <path to password list>` in an attempt to brute force the login. This was taking too long for me, so I just waited for Hydra to finish.
