Here you can find a few (semi-)detailed write-ups of rooms on TryHackMe, with an emphasis on rooms from the Offensive Pentesting learning path. These notes are mostly intended for personal use, but may be helpful for others who are working through these rooms. For obvious reasons, I've tried to avoid spoilers as much as possible.

Useful resources and tools:

- TJnull's [Joplin pentest template](https://github.com/tjnull/TJ-JPT) for note-taking.
- TJnull's [OSCP preparation guide](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2019/03/29/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PWK_OSCP.html).
- [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz) and [Pentest book](https://pentestbook.six2dez.com) for general pentesting methodology.
- [AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon), an incredibly powerful network reconnaissance tool.
- [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/), a list of Unix binaries which can be used for privilege escalation.
- Cheat sheets from [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources), and a useful reverse shell cheat from [pentestmonkey](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet).
