Let's take a look at the webserver. We run gobuster to check for any interesting directories; we can also check the feroxbuster output given by autorecon.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.104.171 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o /home/kali/Documents/THM/Skynet/gobuster.txt -x .php,.txt,.html
```

We see that the machine is hosting Squirrelmail at `/squirrelmail`; we might be able to use this later to access a user's emails.

We also saw that Samba is running on ports 139 and 445. Let's enumerate it. Luckily, autorecon already did this for us.

```txt

```

Autorecon also gave us information about the share permissions and the share contents.

```txt

```

We can also use enum4linux to enumerate the Samba shares. (Autorecon does this, too, by the way.)

Let's access the Samba shares using `smbclient //10.10.104.171/anonymous`. Note that this is the only share which we have access to. We press enter when prompted to input a password, and then we are granted access. Looking around, we find a file called `attention.txt` (which we saw earlier in the enum4linux/autorecon output). Use `get attention.txt` to transfer the file to our local machine. We see that it contains an announcement concerning employee passwords.

</center>

In the same directory containing the `attention.txt` file, we find another directory called `logs` which contains three log files.

<center>

</center>

`log2.txt` and `log3.txt` are empty, but `log1.txt` contains a list of (presumably) passwords. Since we already know a potential point of entry (via Squirrelmail), so let's try to bruteforce milesdyson's password using the list we just found. We could use Hydra to do this; since the password list is relatively short, we'll just do this manually. Luckily, I didn't have to get very far into the list before I got a hit.

</center>

Let's look around. It doesn't take long before we find milesdyson's password.

<center>

![16a7c62d4f22fd5ae4e4c90f8262470b.png](../../_resources/16a7c62d4f22fd5ae4e4c90f8262470b.png)

</center>

We now have access to the milesdyson share. We log in as milesdyson using the password we just found, using the command `smbclient //10.10.104.171/milesdyson -U milesdyson`. We look around for some interesting files.

<center>

</center>

Among the various notes on AI and pandas, we find the aptly-named `important.txt`. We copy this file to our location machine and read it. Item 1 contains a what appears to be a directory. (Admittedly, I knew I was looking for a directory thanks to the THM question prompt. It doesn't look like a standard directory, so maybe it's not so obvious.)

<center>

![c3b68ae0b09efa332f46e132680b23a4.png](../../_resources/c3b68ae0b09efa332f46e132680b23a4.png)

</center>

Navigating to this hidden directory, we find Miles' personal page.

</center>

We can run gobuster again to check for any subdirectories.
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.104.171/<hidden directory>/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

Eventually we find that `/administrator` is a valid subdirectory. Navigating to this page leads to a Cuppa login form.
